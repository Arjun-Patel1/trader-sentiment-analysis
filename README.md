# Trader-Sentiment-Analysis


I imported and loaded data then converted 'date' in sentiment_df to datetime. Then Converted 'Timestamp IST' to datetime and extract only the date part ( format= %d-%m-%Y %H:%M). mrgrd trader and sentiment data.

Then for analysis I did Average and Visualize Closed PnL by Sentiment and then Total Number of Trades per Sentiment, Average Trade Size (USD) per Sentiment.


IN RESULTS I SAW THAT DURING "FEAR" THEY EARN MAX PROFIT AND DURING GREED MAXIMUM LOSS
